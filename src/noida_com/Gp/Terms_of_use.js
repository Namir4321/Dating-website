Dating Services that you have not received will be promptly refunded to you or your representative.
“Disability” means a condition which precludes you from physically using the Dating Services during the
term of disability and the condition is verified in writing by a physician designated and remunerated by
you. Written verification of the physician must be presented to us. This subsection shall supersede any
other contrary term or provision herein.

Services on the day such subscriptions expire. Such renewals shall be (i) for a period equivalent to the
period of your initial subscription to the Services or a shorter period of time if specified, and (ii) in our
discretion, at the price of the same or comparable Services then in effect. In addition, we sometimes
offer special promotions that have renewal periods of different duration than the original subscription
term. We always communicate renewal periods to you upon confirmation of your subscription and in
the body of any special promotions that have renewal periods of different duration than the original
subscription term. By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge that your Account will be subject to the
above-described automatic renewals. In all cases, if you do not wish your Account to renew
automatically, please go to the BILLING HISTORY PAGE and turn auto-renewal off.
